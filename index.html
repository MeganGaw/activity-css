    <h2>Subspecies</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Neochmia ruficauda subclarescens (inhabits in three separate subpopulations, from Pilbara, Fitzroy River Valley and Gibb River, Western Australia to the Northern Territory/ Queensland border.)</li>
    <li>Neochmia ruficauda clarescens (located on the Cape York Peninsula)</li>
    <li>Neochmia ruficauda ruficauda (probably extinct)</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Threats</h2>
    <p>The habitat of Star Finch is threatened by overgrazing plain of grasslands, removing essential cover for their survival as well as sources of food and water. Selective grazing of perennials during the wet season may also remove grasses that are needed for survival during the dry season. Burning of grassland during the dry season may reduce the fallen seed during the wet season and thus reduce the food supply needed by Star Finch. This species is also threatened by cage-bird trades.</p>
